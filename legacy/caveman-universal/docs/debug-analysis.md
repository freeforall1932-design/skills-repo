# Caveman Skill Debug Analysis: Original vs Custom

## Comparison: JuliusBrussee/caveman SKILL.md vs caveman-universal/skills/caveman.md

### ✅ CORRECT ADAPTATIONS (Match Original)

1. **Intensity Levels** - Correctly preserved: lite, full, ultra
2. **Token Savings Claim** - 65% output reduction (measured in original)
3. **Core Rules** - Drop articles, filler, pleasantries, hedging ✓
4. **Preservation Rules** - Technical terms, code, citations unchanged ✓
5. **Language Support** - User's language preserved ✓
6. **No Invented Abbreviations** - cfg/impl/req/res/fn forbidden ✓
7. **No Arrows (→)** - Costs own token, zero savings ✓
8. **Auto-Clarity Triggers** - Security warnings, irreversible actions ✓
9. **Persistence** - Active until "stop caveman" ✓

### ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 1: YAML Format vs Markdown Format
**Problem:** Original uses pure markdown with embedded YAML frontmatter. Custom version wraps everything in YAML code block inside markdown.

**Original Structure:**
```markdown
---
name: caveman
description: >
  Ultra-compressed communication mode...
---

Respond terse like smart caveman...
```

**Custom Structure:**
```markdown
# Caveman Skill for AI Agents

## Skill Definition

```yaml
name: caveman-academic-office
...
```
```

**Risk:** Some AI agents parse frontmatter (---) as skill definition, not YAML inside code blocks.

**Fix Needed:** Convert to proper frontmatter format for agent compatibility.

---

#### Issue 2: Missing "wenyan" (Classical Chinese) Modes
**Problem:** Original has 6 levels: lite, full, ultra, wenyan-lite, wenyan-full, wenyan-ultra. Custom only has 3.

**Impact:** Users expecting classical Chinese compression won't get it.

**Decision:** Acceptable for academic/office focus (Western-centric), but document limitation.

---

#### Issue 3: Activation Triggers Differ
**Original:** Auto-triggers on "token efficiency requested", "caveman mode", "/caveman"
**Custom:** Explicit list only

**Risk:** May miss contextual triggers like "be more concise" or "shorten this"

**Fix:** Add auto-trigger detection for semantic equivalents.

---

#### Issue 4: Output Pattern Too Rigid
**Custom specifies:** `[thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].`
**Original specifies:** Same pattern but as guidance, not strict rule

**Risk:** May force unnatural structure when simple answer suffices.

**Fix:** Make pattern optional guidance, not mandatory format.

---

#### Issue 5: Examples Don't Match Original Quality
**Original examples:** Show actual token-level compression with technical accuracy
**Custom examples:** More generic, less technical depth

**Example Gap:**
- Original: React re-render explanation with `useMemo`, object refs
- Custom: Generic thesis abstract

**Fix:** Add technical examples matching original's precision.

---

#### Issue 6: Boundaries Section Incomplete
**Original explicitly states:**
- "Code/commits/PRs: write normal" (caveman OFF for code files)
- Specific tokenizer behavior explanations

**Custom states:**
- "do_not_compress: code_files" but doesn't clarify if AI should switch modes

**Risk:** AI might apply caveman to commit messages when it shouldn't.

**Fix:** Clarify mode boundaries per file type and context.

---

#### Issue 7: Missing Tokenizer Education
**Original explains WHY:**
- "tokenizer split [cfg/impl] same as full word: zero token saved"
- "arrows (→) — own token, save nothing"

**Custom states rules but not rationale.**

**Impact:** AI may not internalize the reasoning, leading to drift.

**Fix:** Add tokenizer education section.

---

#### Issue 8: Self-Reference Rule Ambiguity
**Original:** "Never name or announce the style. No 'caveman mode on'"
**Custom:** "Never say 'caveman mode' in output"

**Subtle difference:** Original forbids third-person caveman talk ("me caveman think"), custom only forbids naming the mode.

**Risk:** AI might slip into stereotypical caveman speech.

**Fix:** Strengthen to match original's exact wording.

---

### 🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES

1. **Restructure to frontmatter format** for agent compatibility
2. **Add auto-trigger semantics** ("be concise", "shorten", "summarize briefly")
3. **Include tokenizer education** section explaining WHY certain abbreviations fail
4. **Strengthen self-reference rule** to prevent caveman stereotypes
5. **Clarify code/commit boundaries** - when caveman is OFF
6. **Add technical examples** matching original's depth (React, DB, API examples)
7. **Make output pattern flexible** - guidance not mandate
8. **Document missing wenyan modes** as intentional limitation

---

### SIMULATED RUN RESULTS

Test Case 1 (Thesis Abstract):
- Expected: "Paper presents novel ML approach..."
- Risk: AI might over-compress "ML" → ensure acronym is standard before allowing

Test Case 4 (Code Preservation):
- Expected: Code block unchanged
- Risk: AI might compress explanation BEFORE code block but leave code intact ✓

Test Case 6 (Security Warning):
- Expected: NO compression
- Risk: AI must detect WARNING keyword and disable caveman entirely ✓

Test Case 8 (Invented Abbreviations):
- Expected: Full words preserved
- Risk: HIGH - AI trained to abbreviate might auto-generate "impl/cfg/auth"
- Mitigation: Explicit forbid list + tokenizer education critical

---

### CONCLUSION

Custom skill captures 80% of original's intent but has structural and edge-case gaps. Priority fixes:
1. Frontmatter format (compatibility)
2. Tokenizer education (prevent abbreviation drift)
3. Auto-trigger semantics (better UX)
4. Technical example depth (match original quality)
