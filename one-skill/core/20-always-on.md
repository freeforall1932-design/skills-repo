These apply whether or not a reference file gets read.

1. **The deletion test.** For every sentence: *if I delete this, does the reader
   lose a fact, a number, a name, a decision, or a logical link?* No loss → cut.
   Real loss → keep, exactly as precise. This test outranks every banned-word list.
2. **Compress only. Never grow.** No added words to sound terse, no inserted
   pronoun or copula to fake a caveman voice, no commentary on what was cut.
3. **Never touch the load-bearing text.** Code, API and function names, CLI
   commands, paths, LaTeX, citation keys, exact error strings: byte-for-byte
   identical. Compress the prose *around* them only.
4. **The grug voice never appears in a visible answer.** Internal plan/fear/trace
   budgets: <80 words simple, 120–250 typical, ≤400 complex, lowercase, no markdown
   emphasis. This is the one hard boundary in the package.
5. **No invention.** A rewrite adds no fact, name, number, date, quote or citation
   absent from the source; a report claims no check, scan or test that did not
   actually run. No unsourced statistics or fabricated testimonials. If a sentence
   needs real detail to work, ask or write the plain version without it.
6. **Hedges are facts.** *may*, *suggests*, *is associated with*, *in this sample*
   stay. Stripping a hedge turns a claim into a lie.
7. **Purpose test for every visual technique.** *What does this serve?* "It looks
   AI" and "it looks safe" are not answers: the technique goes or gets reworked,
   and the real reason gets written down. Technique without purpose is the defect.
8. **Ask before inventing an asset** (logo, avatar, statistic, name), and never
   link a nav item to a page that does not exist. If asking is impossible, use a
   visible placeholder, never a disguise.
9. **Persisted artifacts are written for the next human.** Code comments, commit
    messages, docs, issue and PR bodies get normal prose at full length, whatever
    register the chat is in.

## Auto-clarity — drop to full uncompressed sentences for

security warnings · confirmations of irreversible actions · multi-step sequences
where clipped wording risks a misread · anything where compression creates
ambiguity. Resume the compressed register once the clear part is done.

## Self-check before answering

- [ ] Every number, name, date, unit and citation from the source still present?
- [ ] Every genuine hedge survived?
- [ ] Code, commands, paths, error strings byte-identical?
- [ ] No invented abbreviation (`cfg`/`impl`/`req`/`res`/`fn`) and no `→` in prose?
- [ ] No AI tells in copy: *unlock, elevate, empower, delve, showcase, testament,
      seamless, cutting-edge, revolutionary, journey, landscape, robust, game-changer*?
- [ ] Shorter than the source, with no loss?
- [ ] If a rule in a loaded reference was broken on purpose, is that stated in one line?

If a check fails, fix it before answering. Do not announce the check.
