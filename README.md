# one skill — grug · caveman · documents · antislop · Pocock · Anthropic

**Everything in this repository, in one skill.** Sixty-nine skills from eight
sources, merged into a single loadable skill: the always-on rules in `SKILL.md`, the
depth in eleven reference files read one at a time.

Token-efficient writing for thesis work, journals, reports and office documents; the
anti-slop filter for interfaces, product copy and diagrams; a real engineering process
from idea to merged PR; security-review method that says what it cannot prove; and
grug's own words from the site they came from. English and Indonesian. Web, app and
agent — no CLI to run.

Where a host cannot carry one big skill, three generated **fragments**
(`one-skill-prose`, `one-skill-code`, `one-skill-design`) ship the same always-on rules
with fewer reference files. They are a fallback, built from the same manifest.

```bash
python one-skill/build.py all     # rebuild the one skill from its manifest
```

## Install

There is one artifact, and it is generated. Upload or copy it; do not edit it.

| Where | What to install |
|---|---|
| **Claude app / claude.ai** | [`claude-skills/app/zips/one-skill.zip`](claude-skills/app/zips/one-skill.zip) — Settings → Capabilities → enable *Code execution and file creation*, then Customize → Skills → Upload |
| **Claude Code** | open this repo ([`.claude/skills/one-skill/`](.claude/skills/one-skill) auto-loads) or `cp -r claude-skills/app/one-skill ~/.claude/skills/` |
| **Codex / Cursor / Copilot / OpenCode / Qwen Code** | [`claude-skills/app/one-skill/`](claude-skills/app/one-skill) into the agent's skill directory, or its `SKILL.md` into `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursor/rules/` |
| **Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Kimi** (no skill uploader) | paste [`pseudo-skills/one-skill.md`](pseudo-skills/one-skill.md), then paste a reference file when a task needs one |
| **a host that finds one 2.4k-word skill too much** | [`claude-skills/fragments/zips/one-skill-{prose,code,design}.zip`](claude-skills/fragments) — same always-on rules, two to six reference files instead of eleven. Install one *instead* of `one-skill`, never beside it |

Then write as usual, or say `caveman`, `be brief`, or `ringkas`. Stop with
`stop caveman` / `stop grug` / `normal mode`.

## What you see, and what you never see

| You see | You do not see |
|---|---|
| Tight prose in the register the destination owns | the grug internal monologue |
| Facts, numbers, citations and hedges intact | an invented figure or a stripped *may* |
| Code, LaTeX and `[@Cite2023]` byte-for-byte identical | "compressed" code that no longer runs |
| Interfaces with a stated purpose behind each technique | gradient-and-glass defaults, unsourced stats, fake testimonials |
| A spec → tickets → implement → review → PR path, on request | a process skill run uninvited |

## The one line

> **grug decides, caveman measures, documents stay professional, antislop filters,
> pocock runs the process, and nobody touches the code.**

Those sources were not written for each other, and they contradict each other in
places. A merge that hides that produces a skill that fails in both directions at
once, so the conflicts are named and resolved **by destination** — in
[`one-skill/core/10-precedence.md`](one-skill/core/10-precedence.md). The short
version:

| The output is… | It reads like | Never like |
|---|---|---|
| a chat reply to a developer | caveman: terse, fragments allowed | formal |
| a document a person reads | the document register: full grammar, zero waste | cartoon caveman |
| product UI copy | antislop-copywriting | AI tells, unsourced claims |
| code, paths, errors, LaTeX, citations | untouched | compressed |
| a persisted artifact (comment, commit, PR body) | normal prose, full length | shorthand a future human decodes |

## What is merged, and how

`one-skill/sources.json` is the manifest; `one-skill/build.py` is the merge. Every
upstream body is carried **verbatim** — same as the four variants this repo used to
publish, taken from [grugbrain.dev](https://grugbrain.dev/) and
[JuliusBrussee/caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) and not
paraphrased. What the merge adds is the routing layer.

Every source is vendored from its **origin at the latest commit**, never from a fork —
including the anti-slop fork's own upstream, which was byte-identical to it.

The last two arrived as archives committed to this repository rather than as a remote, so
they are pinned by the file's **sha256**: `sync` extracts the archive, records the digest in
`upstream/PROVENANCE.json`, and the manifest pins that digest. Re-upload a version, get a new
pin, and every declared edit is re-checked against the new bytes. Replacing an archive without
re-running `sync` fails the build, because the digest no longer matches.

"Of N" is a count of what was deliberately **not** merged, and every one of those
skills is listed with its reason inside the skill, in `references/SOURCES.md`: Strix's
skills drive a Docker-launched scanner, mem0's drive an SDK and an API key, and
Archify's renderer is 6 MB of Node pipeline. None of it is implementable from a
markdown file, so none of it is carried as decoration.

`mattpocock/skills` also ships `skills/in-progress/` (betas with no docs pages that
can vanish without warning) and `skills/deprecated/` (empty by policy). Neither is
merged; `sources.json` says so on the record. `caveman` v3.2.0's nine
Caveman-Cloud/plugin skills are not merged either, for the same reason: they install
or talk to a service. There is no upstream repository for *be-brief* — searched
2026-10-10, only unrelated `antislop-*` sampler repos exist — its text was this
repository's own, which is also why retiring it cost no provenance: on 2026-10-11 the
register layer it argued for was retired to `legacy/`, because its deletion test, output
contract and self-check had become the always-on rules, and its `lite/full/ultra` levels
survive in `caveman-output` and the registers table. The one job still worth a procedure —
summarising a long report or document — is `one-skill/written/document-summary.md`, written
for this bundle in a professional register instead of a slang one.

Four escapes let a merged skill stay honest, and all four fail the build when they go
stale:

- `strip_sections` drops an upstream section that only makes sense for a standalone
  install (antislop's download wizard, Strix's `strix` command blocks).
- `keep_sections` is its inverse, for a skill that is mostly a driver for a tool this
  bundle does not ship: carry the two or three sections that work anyway, drop the
  rest **by name** instead of paraphrasing them into something the author never wrote.
- `replace` makes a literal wording edit where upstream would otherwise make this skill
  lie about its own layout ("run `node bin/archify.mjs`", "see `delivery-contract.md`").
- `markup` strips page furniture from a source that is really a generated web page —
  grug's site uses anchor-wrapped headings, and the prose underneath is untouched.

Each one is listed per section in `references/SOURCES.md` inside the skill, next to the
table of everything that was cast aside and why. `build.py` refuses to emit a bundle
where a skill upstream has — not merely one that was copied down — is neither merged
nor excused.

**Adding a fourth repository is a manifest entry and a rebuild**, not a rewrite:
[`one-skill/README.md`](one-skill/README.md) has the four steps.

```
one-skill/
├── sources.json     ← the manifest: sources, skills, buckets, strips
├── build.py         ← sync · build · install · all · check
├── core/            ← the hand-written merge: layers, precedence, always-on, router
├── upstream/        ← vendored copies, revision-pinned in PROVENANCE.json
├── dist/skill/      ← ★ the single skill
└── tests/           ← 24 tests: fidelity, dead links, budget, determinism, staleness
```

## Inside the skill

| File | Read it when |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | always: nine universal rules, precedence, router, commands |
| `references/write-prose.md` | thesis, journal, report, memo, email, docs, landing copy |
| `references/terse-chat.md` | chat, status, diagnosis, log-reading, one-shot compression |
| `references/think-first.md` | before acting; when a plan needs attacking; `ralph on` |
| `references/code-craft.md` | module design, tests, debugging, prototypes, comments |
| `references/ship-workflow.md` | spec → tickets → implement → review → PR → retro |
| `references/ui-craft.md` | any interface: colour, layout, components, motion |
| `references/responsive-access.md` | reflow across sizes, contrast, keyboard, focus |
| `references/setup-repo.md` | first use of the process skills, git guardrails, hooks |
| `references/teach-and-author.md` | writing a skill or `AGENTS.md`; teaching a concept |
| `references/origins.md` | you want the argument behind a ruling, in upstream's words |

**Intensity:** `lite` (emails, journals) · `full` (default) · `ultra` (summaries).
**Ralph loop:** `ralph off` (default) · `once` · `on` · `max 3`. **Antislop mode:**
`antislop during` · `antislop after` (numbered findings, you pick) · `antislop ask`.

## Numbers

Measured on the four documents this skill is built from, using that corpus; not
re-measured on the merged bundle. The merged skill changes what is *always loaded*,
not what the rules cost when a task runs.

| Metric | Value | When |
|---|---|---|
| Output token savings | ~65% | chat and prose (thesis, reports, email) |
| Output token savings | ~8–21% | structured coding/document tasks |
| Input token savings | ~46% | after `caveman-compress` on a document |
| Data loss | 0% | verified across all test runs |
| Always loaded, per request | 2394 / 2400 words | `SKILL.md`, budgeted and enforced by `build.py` (the builder's `split()` count, stricter than `wc -w`); the budget is what forced the prose out of it, not a rounding |
| On demand | 90k words | eleven reference files, loaded one at a time |
| Vendored skills | 78 routed, 34 recorded as dropped | across ten sources: 22 whole skills, 11 files, 8 vendoring records, each with a reason |
| Tests | 56 | fidelity, links, budgets, determinism, published copies, the excuses themselves |

Source: original caveman benchmarks plus independent replication (JetBrains,
community tests). These were measured on the standalone registers, not on this merged
bundle, and they have not been re-run here — treat them as the claim the register rules
were built to serve, not as a measurement of `one-skill`. Notes:
[`legacy/caveman-universal/docs/relationship-with-caveman.md`](legacy/caveman-universal/docs/relationship-with-caveman.md).

## Relationship to upstream caveman

Still a companion, not a replacement.
[JuliusBrussee/caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) (v3.2.0, the revision
this bundle vendors) is a
compression engine for tool output, logs and JSON, plus MCP via `npx caveman-shrink`.
Use that for everyday coding; use this for writing, design judgment and process.

| | Official caveman | one skill |
|--|------------------|-----------|
| Method | cut-the-fluff prose | same deletion test, plus its sources' rules |
| Languages | universal | **English + Indonesian** |
| Deploy | CLI, MCP, npm, agent SDK | **one skill folder — no CLI** |
| Reasoning | none | **grug** (hidden) |
| Iteration | none | **ralph** (opt-in) |
| Interface design | out of scope | **antislop** filter + accessibility gate |
| Engineering process | out of scope | **31 Pocock skills**, as commands |
| Code in output | preserved | **preserved, byte-exact** |

## Train it, do not hand-tune it

[`skillopt-integration/`](skillopt-integration/README.md) connects to
[**SkillOpt**](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt) (via
[`freeforall1932-design/SkillOpt-fork`](https://github.com/freeforall1932-design/SkillOpt-fork)),
which treats the skill document as the trainable state of a frozen model and
optimises it behind a held-out validation gate. Its reward function encodes the
philosophy — fact and hedge retention, byte-exact code, compression achieved,
register fidelity — and gates out the degenerate "echo the input" solution.

```bash
pip install skillopt && pip install -e skillopt-integration
python -m caveman_skillopt.train --config skillopt-integration/configs/be-brief.yaml
```

It trains the four register documents under `legacy/`, per register, because
averaging the registers is how the conflict gets optimised away. A trained
`best_skill.md` becomes an input to the merge: drop it into
`one-skill/upstream/local/`, point that skill's `entry` at it, rebuild. Training the
merged bundle as one document is the obvious next step and is not done yet.

`legacy/` is frozen: read it, do not add to it. It stays because
`skillopt-integration/` trains against those documents and because the reasoning
behind the registers is written down there.
