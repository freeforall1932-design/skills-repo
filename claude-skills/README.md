# Claude Skills — install guide

One skill, one format. Everything the old six-skill matrix covered is inside it.

| Surface | What to install | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude app & claude.ai** (Settings → Customize → Skills → Upload) | [`app/zips/one-skill.zip`](app/zips/one-skill.zip) | upload the ZIP |
| **Claude Code / agent SDK** | [`app/one-skill/`](app/one-skill/) | `cp -r claude-skills/app/one-skill ~/.claude/skills/`, or open this repo: [`.claude/skills/one-skill/`](../.claude/skills/one-skill) auto-loads |
| **Codex, Cursor, Copilot, OpenCode, Qwen Code** | same folder | copy it into the agent's skill directory; paste [`../pseudo-skills/one-skill.md`](../pseudo-skills/one-skill.md) where there is no uploader |

Format requirements, still verified against Anthropic's documentation:

* the ZIP must contain `one-skill/SKILL.md`
* `SKILL.md` must start with `---` on line 1
* `name` + `description` are the only frontmatter fields the surface requires; the
  description limit is 200 chars on the app and 1024 on Claude Code, and this one is
  written for the wider limit. If the app rejects it, trim the description in the
  upload dialog rather than editing the file — the file is generated.

## Do not hand-edit anything here

`app/one-skill/` is the published copy of the build, written by
`python one-skill/build.py` from
[`../one-skill/sources.json`](../one-skill/sources.json) and
[`../one-skill/core/`](../one-skill/core). (The scratch tree it comes from,
`one-skill/dist/`, is gitignored and does not exist in a fresh checkout.) A hand edit is overwritten
on the next build, and CI fails the pull request that ships one. To change what the
skill says, change the manifest or [`one-skill/core/`](../one-skill/core) and rebuild.

## What is inside

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | the always-loaded half: nine universal rules, precedence by destination, the router, the command table |
| `references/*.md` | eleven on-demand files, one per destination: prose, chat, thinking, code craft, ship workflow, UI and diagrams, reflow + access, repo setup, teaching, security method, origins |
| `references/SOURCES.md` | which upstream file every section came from, what was not carried, and why |
| `scripts/` | the carried executables: `contrast-check.py` (the WCAG AA gate), `block-dangerous-git.sh`, and the diagnosis and wizard templates |
| `BUILD.json` | a checksum for every input, so a vendored file that moved without a rebuild is detectable |

The previous setup spread ~1.5k words of rules across six documents; this is one
2.4k-word file plus nothing, with 87k words behind it read a file at a time.

## Fallback fragments — [`../fragments/`](../fragments)

| Install | For | Reference files |
|---|---|---|
| `zips/one-skill-prose.zip` | anything a human reads: documents, email, theses, chat replies, and the reasoning behind them | 5 |
| `zips/one-skill-code.zip` | working in a repo: design, tests, debugging, review, commits, setup, security method | 6 |
| `zips/one-skill-design.zip` | screens and diagrams: the anti-slop filter, reflow and accessibility | 3 |

Each is generated from the same manifest as `one-skill` and carries the same
always-on rules; only the reference files are a subset. They exist for a host that
cannot do the two-hop read (open `SKILL.md`, then one reference), or that treats a
bundle this size as a cost. Install **one** of them *instead* of `one-skill` — never
beside it, or the always-on rules load twice. A fragment names what it left out, and
says to stop rather than guess when a task turns into something else.

## The six-skill era

The old set — `caveman`, `caveman-be-brief`, `caveman-compress`, `caveman-review`,
`grug-reasoning`, `ralph-wiggum`, their ZIPs, and this file's much longer
predecessor — is in [`../legacy/claude-skills/`](../legacy/claude-skills). Readable
for reference, and still what `skillopt-integration/` trains against, but no longer
an install path.
